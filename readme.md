Pokemon API Project
The purpose of this project is to have a basic pokemon fan page with a list of different pages to choose from.
the pokemon page will allow users to search for pokemon and with the help of the api it will call back the pokemon with the sprite name and stats along with types.
the berries page will map all the berries currently in the pokemon world.
